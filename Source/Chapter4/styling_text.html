  <h1>About Us</h1>
  
  <p>Spaghetti and Cruft opened our doors in 1999, bringing great pizza and 
  pasta to the heart of the city's trendy Riverbend district. We handcraft 
  our pizzas on the spot using only the best ingredients, and then we bake them to 
  perfection in our rustic wood-fired brick oven. We sell pizza by the slice 
  or by the pie and even offer catering for any occasion all around the 
  neighborhood.</p>

  <p>Our broad menu of pasta dishes puts a modern twist on Old Italia, served 
  in heaping bowlfuls sure to satisfy any appetite (though we bet you'll want 
  seconds anyway). But it's not all noodles and crust at Spaghetti and Cruft; 
  we also have fresh veggie sides, an all-you-can-eat salad bar, and the best 
  cannolis in town!</p>
